# **TrackLifts Support & FAQs**  

**Need help?** This guide covers common questions about **TrackLifts**, a workout-tracking app that helps you log exercises, build routines, and organize workout splits.  

## **📌 Getting Started**  
### **How do I create an exercise?**  
1. Tap **Exercises** → **+ (Add New)**.  
2. Enter the exercise name (e.g., "Barbell Bench Press").  
3. Select the **primary muscles worked** (e.g., Chest, Triceps).  
4. Adjust the **intensity sliders** for each muscle (Low/Medium/High).  
5. Save the exercise to use it in routines!  

### **How do I build a Routine?**  
1. Go to **Routines** → **+ (Create New)**.  
2. Name your routine (e.g., "Upper Body Day").  
3. Add exercises from your library and set reps/sets/weight.  
4. Save the routine to use in a **Split** or log it directly in workouts.  

### **What’s a Workout Split?**

To create a Split:  
1. Go to **Splits** → **+ (New Split)**.  
2. Name it (e.g., "5-Day Bodybuilding Split").

## **❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**  

### **🔹 How does TrackLifts recommend routines?**  
When you have an **active Split**, the app checks your workout history and suggests the next routine in the cycle.  

### **🔹 Can I edit or delete exercises/routines?**  
Yes! Swipe left on any item (exercise/routine/split) to edit or delete it.  

### **🔹 Where is my data stored?**  
All data is stored **locally** on your device (no cloud/server storage). Uninstalling the app will erase your data.  

### **🔹 Why can’t I see my workout history?**  
Check the **Progress** tab. If data is missing, ensure you’ve logged workouts under "Start Workout" (not just saved routines).  

### **🔹 How do I track workout intensity?**  
The app estimates intensity based on:  
- Volume (sets x reps x weight)  
- Muscle engagement (per exercise settings)  
- Historical performance
